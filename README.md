- This is my personal repository that also resoponsible for official works with my colleagues on theoretical research of Computer Science. 
  - I hope the materials here will give relieves to such persons that might be skeptical on the claims expressed in our submitted or published papers.
  - It's also a pleasure of mine that the source codes would inspire someone else to make his/her tasks to be coded more excellent.
