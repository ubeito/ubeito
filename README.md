- This is a personal repository but also resoponsible for official works with others on theoretical research of computation. 
  - I hope the materials displayed here will give credits to persons who might be skeptical on the claims expressed in submitted or publised papers of us.
  - It's also a pleasure that the sorce codes would inspire someone else to make his/her tasks to code easier via their similarity to us.
