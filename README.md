- This is a personal repository but also resoponsible for official works with others on theoretical research of computation. 
- I hope the materials displayed here will give confirmations to persons who might be skeptical on the claims expressed in our submitted or publised papers.
- It's also a pleasuree that the contents of sorce codes would inspire someone else to make his/her similar tasks easier.
